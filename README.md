- 🌱 I’m currently learning Software development online, I was sharping my knowledge and skills in coding thanks to the Software development training initiated by Tech4dev, where I contribute to manage and editing some detail in a website. Right now I'm in the Numeric Orientation program and I learn some stuff, really passionnating.

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any interresting project, which means basic project for the moment, I also need some recommendation regarding Cloud Program or something else. Thanks in advance
